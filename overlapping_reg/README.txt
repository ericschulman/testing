overlap_shi_ex_pt_slow.ipynb
- main examples from paper, main reason slow is because i do analytical log likelihood... maybe to a version with correct guess?
- uses test v3, v3 does not actually re estimate the models in the bootstrap samples to save time.

1v1 
- trying to guage 1v1 regressor what happens...

shi_examples_summer_1
- same as overlap_shi_ex_pt.ipynb. updates include v5 test. v5 test includes bias correction on regular test. 

shi_examples_summer_2
- same as overlap_shi_ex_pt_slow.ipynb. updates include v5 test. v5 test includes bias correction on regular test. 

kstat_table
- code to get the tables with the k-stats working

edgeworth_summer_2
- actual examples
- k = 9, 100, 250, 500 obs
- k = 4?
- k = 15?
- a = 0, 100, 250, 500 obs



edgeworth_shi_pt 
- examples from xiaoxia's paper

edgeworth_reg2_pt
- disorganized examples, includes the non-overlapping case, also includes code for doing the k-stats... will hopefully be outdated soon
